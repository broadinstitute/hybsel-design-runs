# hybsel-design-runs
Input for hybsel probe design and output (probe sets) of running the design tool.

* On Jun 12, 2017, everything in the results/hybsel\_design/ dir in my hayden-work repo was moved into this new repository. Some of these files were moved within the hayden-work repo, and the latest (and only) commit in the history here for those files is that move; additional commit history for these files is in the log of the hayden-work repo.
