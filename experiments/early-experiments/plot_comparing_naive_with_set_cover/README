- Plot titled "Scaling probe count with additional genomes" from early 2015 presentations
- The 'naive' approach is LCS (longest common substring) together with dominating set
    - So not completely naive (just tiling), but still based on the idea of reducing probe redundancies
- The other approach is the set cover approach
- Uses a 100 bp shared string (lcf_thres=100) and 0 mismatches
- Over Ebola Zaire genomes with 100% coverage

(Note in 2017-11: I can't remember, but probe counts for the naive approach were
probably produced using the script 'make_probes_by_redundancy_reduction.py' that
existed early in the hybsel_design repo.)
