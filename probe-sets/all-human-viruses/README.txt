Up through 2016-06/:
    ~300-virus probe set intended to target all viruses pathogenic to humans

      - recent-data/ gives a probe set for each virus for different
        choices of parameters
      - 2016-06/ has the probe set that was synthesized in summer, 2016 and
        tested throughout 2016-2017; 2016-06/params_decided.txt gives the
        parameters for this probe set (i.e., for run-247 with 350000 probes),
        and the data (i.e., probe sets for each virus for each choice of
        parameters) is in recent-data/


2018-10/ is processed differently. It has more than 300 viruses, and
recent-data/ is not used for the design of that probe set. See
2018-10/README.txt for details.
