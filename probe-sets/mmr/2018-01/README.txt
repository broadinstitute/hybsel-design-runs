This is a probe set with mumps, measles, and rubella. It is
designed for Bettina Bankamp and Min-hsin Chen at the CDC.

For the curation of the specific input to this, see the email
thread "Re: pan-viral probes" started on Jan 9, 2018. Namely,
this uses all the sequences in CATCH at commit 83b96f9, plus
the additional sequences in additional-input/.

The parameters used in the pooling are pool/param-choices.tsv
and the final probe set is pool/mmr-pooled-probes.fasta.
