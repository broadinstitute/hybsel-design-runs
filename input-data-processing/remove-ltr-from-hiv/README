If we download a single fasta with all HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2) sequences
  (hiv.fasta), then start with step (1).
If we have HIV-1 genomes and HIV-2 genomes already separated into two
  FASTA files, then start with step (2). The fasta files given in this
  directory were downloaded from GenBank, but were not split using
  step (1). They should include the sequences in hiv.fasta, as well as
  additional sequences. So hiv-1.fasta and hiv-2.fasta should include
  more sequences combined than hiv.fasta. hiv-1.fasta came from
  scripts/download-genbank-viral-genomes/existing/data/hiv1.fasta and
  hiv-2.fasta came from
  scripts/download-genbank-viral-genomes/existing/data/hiv2.fasta.

1) Split hiv.fasta (all isolates) into HIV-1 and HIV-2:
   a) cd viral-work/scripts/fasta-processing/
   b) python split_by_regex.py -i ../../data-processing/remove-ltr-from-hiv/hiv.fasta -r ".*HIV-2.*|.*virus 2.*|.*type 2.*" -o1 ../../data-processing/remove-ltr-from-hiv/hiv-2.fasta -o2 ../../data-processing/remove-ltr-from-hiv/hiv-1.fasta
   c) Manually move 'gi|60256|emb|X61240.1| Huma Immunodeficiency Virus Isolate D205, complete genome'
        from hiv-1.fasta to hiv-2.fasta

[Note that I took out the reference sequence that was in hiv-1.fasta (which came from
hiv.fasta) and inserted my own reference sequence (from hiv1_ref.fasta) into hiv-1.fasta.]

Do on each HIV-1 and HIV-2 (example showing HIV-2):
2) Perform multiple sequence alignment across all isolate sequences (the reference sequence
     should be one of these sequences -- it is for hiv-1.fasta and hiv-2.fasta):
   muscle -in hiv-2.fasta -out hiv-2.aligned.fasta
3) Using the reference sequence in hiv-2.aligned.fasta, remove the LTRs from all the
     other sequences:
   python remove_ltr.py -i hiv-2.aligned.fasta -o hiv-2_no-ltr.fasta -s hiv2
4) Do a sanity check by looking at lengths:
   a) Check lengths with the LTRs:
      python ../../scripts/fasta-processing/print_lengths.py -i hiv-2.fasta
   b) Notice that the total length of the reference (name with 'ref') is 10359
   c) Add up the length of the LTRs. For HIV-2, the 5' is 855 bp long and the
        3' is 10359-9504=855 bp long. So 1710 bp in total.
   d) The length of the ref without the LTR should therefore be 10359-1710 = 8649 bp.
   e) Check lengths without the LTRs:
      python ../../scripts/fasta-processing/print_lengths.py -i hiv-2_no-ltr.fasta
   f) Notice that the length of the reference without the LTR is 8649 bp long.
   g) Notice that most sequences without the LTR have a length around 8649 bp.
