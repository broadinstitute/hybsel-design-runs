"""Dataset with '[[VIRUS_REGEX]]' sequences.

A dataset with [[NUM_SEQUENCES]] '[[VIRUS_REGEX]]' sequences. The virus is segmented and has [[NUM_SEGMENTS]] segments. Based on their strain and/or isolate, these sequences were able to be grouped into [[NUM_GENOMES]] genomes. Many genomes may have fewer than [[NUM_SEGMENTS]] segments.
